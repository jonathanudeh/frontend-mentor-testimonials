### My-process
- Built-with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid and flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What-I-learned
I learnt alot about responsiveness. Displaying designs based on the device view (mobile or desktop).

### Continued-development
Like I always say, I will be using more of css grid layout as well as flexbox so as to get really familiarized with them both.
